      <h1>Information Technology Definition</h1>
      <p>Information technology (IT) is the use of any computers, storage,
         networking and other physical devices, infrastructure, and processes
         to create, process, store, secure, and exchange all forms of electronic
         data. Typically, IT is used in the context of business operations, as
         opposed to the technology used for personal or entertainment purposes.The
         commercial use of IT encompasses both <b>computer technology</b> and
         <b>telecommunications</b>.Information technology is used by everyone from
         enterprise companies down to one-person businesses and
         local operations. Global companies use it to manage data and
         innovate their processes. Even flea market sellers use a smartphone
         credit card readers to collect payments and street performers give out
         a Venmo name to gather donations. Information technology drives much of
         what we do in our personal and professional lives. It is the foundation of
         our communication, technological advancement, innovation, sustainability and
         recreation. We use information technology on a personal level to connect and
         communicate with others, play games, share media, shop, and be social. Information
         technology drives much of what we do in our personal and professional lives.
